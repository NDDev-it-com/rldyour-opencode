# Browser Workflow

## Scope
browser-visible validation and debugging workflows

## Current source of truth
- `path:README.md`
- `path:.opencode/skills`
- `path:opencode.json`
- `path:references/rldyour-contract.json`
- `path:scripts/validate_browser_provider_policy.py`

## Last verified
- date: 2026-07-10
- commit: `d066d07c5b4a0bb4f37c64040e21d085ba0a5747`
- checked by: OpenCode CloakBrowser skill-boundary verification

## Facts
- Before every browser action, run exact `$HOME/.local/bin/cloakbrowser-cdp-health`; missing or nonzero health stops as `NOT_PROVEN`.
- Browser execution is limited to exact `$HOME/.local/bin/playwright-cli` and the exact managed Chrome DevTools MCP wrapper from `opencode.json`. `run-code` and `--filename` are forbidden.
- `webwright-task` is a compatibility workflow routed to the managed providers. The Webwright Python runtime, stock/raw/in-app Browser, browser-agent/repl/computer-use surfaces, raw Playwright, direct packages, alternate CDP/executable/config paths, and all fallbacks are forbidden.

## Evidence
- `commit:d066d07c5b4a0bb4f37c64040e21d085ba0a5747`
- `path:README.md`
- `path:.opencode/skills`
- `path:opencode.json`
- `path:references/rldyour-contract.json`
- `path:scripts/validate_browser_provider_policy.py`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
Update after verified changes to the referenced source-of-truth files.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.

## Applies to

- The scope and source-of-truth paths declared in this memory.

## Source of truth

- The `Current source of truth` entries above, plus current code, configuration, tests, git state, and live GitHub state where this memory references live release or repository surfaces.

## Invariants

- Current code, configuration, tests, validators, git state, and live GitHub state override this memory whenever they disagree.

## Current State

- Treat the `Facts` section as the current durable state. Do not treat historical evidence, superseded notes, or previous release entries as current.

## Do Not Infer

- Do not infer runtime versions, product versions, commits, permissions, release state, security posture, or tool behavior from this memory without checking the source of truth.

## Update Triggers

- Update after verified changes to the source-of-truth files, runtime baselines, release tuple, validation gates, live release state, or durable agent-workflow contracts.

## Validation Commands

- Run `python3 scripts/validate_browser_provider_policy.py` to verify the exact boundary in all six browser skills, the managed provider inventory, the exact Chrome transport, and health-gated command examples.
- Run the rldyour control-plane Serena memory validators in strict mode: `validate_serena_memory_schema` (`--strict-mode strict-all`) and `validate_serena_memory_semantics` (`--strict-current-facts --strict-metadata-dates --strict-evidence-commits`).

## Repair Procedure

1. Re-read the source-of-truth files listed above.
2. Update only verified current facts; move stale facts into historical evidence.
3. Rerun the validation commands until green.
