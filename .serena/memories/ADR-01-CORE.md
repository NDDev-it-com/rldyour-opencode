# ADR Core

## Scope
architecture decisions and owner-approved policy changes

## Current source of truth
- `path:docs/decisions`

## Last verified

## Facts
- ADR memories record decisions and policy shape. Meaning changes require explicit owner approval.

## Evidence
- `commit:d93a558050d54a80e578035d0e1627385ec7c1e4`
- `path:docs/decisions`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
ADR meaning changes require explicit owner approval; format-only normalization may be done without changing the decision.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.
