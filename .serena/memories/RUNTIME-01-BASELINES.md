# Runtime Baselines

## Scope
CLI runtime and package baselines

## Current source of truth
- `path:references/opencode-baseline.json`

## Last verified
- date: 2026-05-22

## Facts
- Runtime memories record pinned CLI/package baselines and freshness checks.

## Evidence
- `commit:d93a558050d54a80e578035d0e1627385ec7c1e4`
- `path:references/opencode-baseline.json`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
Update after verified changes to the referenced source-of-truth files.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.
