# LSP Routing

## Purpose

Choose the correct language-server workflow before coding. The goal is accurate diagnostics, semantic navigation, and low-entropy implementation without pretending every file type is Serena-native.

User-facing conversation stays Russian unless requested otherwise. Repository docs and plugin files stay English.

## When To Use

Use this skill when a task involves:

- LSPs, language servers, diagnostics, type checking, symbol navigation, code intelligence, or semantic refactoring.
- Project setup for Python, Rust, Dart, Flutter, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, C, C++, Qt, QML, YAML, Docker, HTML, CSS, Shell, JSON, TOML, or Markdown.
- Choosing whether Serena MCP can provide semantic tools for a file type.
- Preparing a high-quality implementation where language-server feedback matters.

## Routing Rules

1. Detect the language from files, manifests, lockfiles, and build files, not from file extensions alone when project structure matters.
2. Read `references/lsp-server-matrix.md` when exact command names, Serena keys, or prerequisites matter.
3. Use `serena-lsp-integration` when the question affects Serena project languages, `.serena/project.yml`, `ls_specific_settings`, or `serena project index`.
4. Use `lsp-health-check` when the user asks whether LSPs work, when a project has missing diagnostics, or before non-trivial code work in a newly seen stack.
5. Use `lsp-setup` only after an explicit user request to install or update tools.

## Default Decisions

- Python: Pyright for semantic analysis, Ruff as companion lint/format tooling.
- TypeScript and JavaScript: `typescript-language-server` by default. Use `typescript_vts` (vtsls) only when explicitly requested or project evidence requires it.
- Rust: `rust-analyzer` and `rust-src`.
- Dart and Flutter: Dart SDK analyzer, with Flutter SDK awareness for Flutter projects.
- Go: `gopls` only inside a real module or workspace.
- C, C++, Qt C++: `clangd` and `compile_commands.json`.
- Qt QML: `qmlls` externally; do not claim Serena-native QML support.
- YAML: `yaml-language-server` plus schemas.
- Docker: Docker Language Server externally.
- HTML/CSS/JSON: `vscode-langservers-extracted`.
- Shell: `bash-language-server` plus `shellcheck`.
- TOML: Taplo.
- Markdown: Marksman.

OpenCode has 30+ built-in LSP servers that auto-start when file extensions are detected. Enable in `opencode.json` with `"lsp": true`. No manual `.lsp.json` needed.

For custom LSP configuration, use `opencode.json` -> `lsp` object with per-server overrides.

## Runtime Safety

Do not start a `stdio` language server manually unless a real LSP client controls the session. For checks, verify command availability, versions, and project prerequisites.

Do not use first-run `bunx` or `uvx` as a long-lived LSP runtime. Use stable local executables. Package managers are allowed for explicit setup and health checks.

## Anti-patterns

- Running `bunx package --stdio` or `uvx package --stdio` as long-lived LSP runtime.
- Starting `stdio` LSP manually for testing (it hangs without an LSP client).
- Claiming Serena-native support for QML/Docker/HTML/CSS without upstream confirmation.
- Using `typescript_vts` by default instead of `typescript-language-server` without explicit project requirement.
- Ignoring `compile_commands.json` for C/C++ (it is a correctness blocker).
