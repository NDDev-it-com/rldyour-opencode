# FSD Frontend Architecture

## Purpose

Keep frontend design implementation structurally clean and scalable. Default to strict Feature-Sliced Design for React application code.

## When To Use

Use this skill without waiting for explicit invocation when the task involves:

- Deciding where frontend code belongs in `app`, `pages`, `widgets`, `features`, `entities`, or `shared`.
- Moving generated Figma, shadcn/ui, ReactBits, or custom UI code into production architecture.
- Adding public APIs, fixing imports, preventing cross-slice internals, or reducing duplicated UI structure.
- Separating reusable primitives from business features and page composition.
- Keeping a design implementation scalable instead of page-local and ad hoc.

Use it together with `design-system-implementation` whenever token or shared UI placement is involved.

## Layers

Use these layers only:

- `app`: routing, providers, root layouts, global styles, app-level initialization.
- `pages`: route-level screens and page-specific composition.
- `widgets`: large self-contained UI blocks or page sections that combine features/entities/shared.
- `features`: user actions that provide business value.
- `entities`: domain entities and their UI/model/api where appropriate.
- `shared`: reusable UI primitives, assets, tokens, config, API clients, libs without business logic.

Do not use the deprecated `processes` layer. Although the official FSD docs still list it, this project treats it as deprecated and routes its responsibilities into `app`/`pages`/`widgets` depending on scope.

## Import Rule

Files can import only from lower layers:

- `app` can import from all lower layers.
- `pages` can import from `widgets`, `features`, `entities`, `shared`.
- `widgets` can import from `features`, `entities`, `shared`.
- `features` can import from `entities`, `shared`.
- `entities` can import from `shared`.
- `shared` imports only internal shared segments or external libraries.

Slices on the same layer must not import each other's internals. Use public APIs.

## Public API Rule

Every slice and relevant segment must expose a public API, usually `index.ts`.

External imports must target public APIs, not internal files:

- Good: `import { UserCard } from "@/entities/user"`.
- Bad: `import { UserCard } from "@/entities/user/ui/UserCard"`.

## Design Placement

Use this placement by default:

- Design tokens: `shared/config/theme` or the existing centralized theme location.
- shadcn primitives: `shared/ui`.
- ReactBits primitives/effects: `shared/ui` if generic, otherwise the owning widget/feature.
- Reusable icons/assets: `shared/assets`.
- Domain-specific assets: owning entity/feature/widget/page slice.
- Page-specific layout: `pages/<page>/ui`.
- Large reusable page sections: `widgets/<widget>/ui`.
- User actions: `features/<feature>/ui`, `features/<feature>/model`, `features/<feature>/api`.
- Domain UI/data: `entities/<entity>/ui`, `entities/<entity>/model`, `entities/<entity>/api`.

## Figma And Generated Code

Never paste generated Figma, shadcn, or ReactBits code blindly.

Before committing generated or copied code:

1. Remove demo-only code, unused props, unused variants, placeholder assets, and unrelated styles.
2. Replace raw design values with centralized tokens.
3. Split code into FSD-appropriate slices and segments.
4. Add or update public APIs.
5. Preserve existing project conventions.
6. Validate in browser.

## Output

For design implementation, report in Russian:

- `Placement`: layer/slice/segment decisions.
- `Public APIs`: new or changed exports.
- `Architecture constraints`: import boundaries or compromises.
- `Generated code adaptation`: what was removed, tokenized, or moved.
- `Validation`: checks proving the placement works.

## Anti-patterns

- Using deprecated `processes` layer.
- Cross-slice internals imports (`@/entities/user/ui/UserCard` instead of `@/entities/user`).
- Imports from upper layer in lower (`shared` imports from `features`).
- Business logic in `shared/ui`.
- Page-local UI that needs reuse in other pages — that is a widget or shared.
- Pasting generated code without architectural cleanup.
