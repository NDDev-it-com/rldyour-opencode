# Playwright CLI Validation

## Mandatory CloakBrowser Boundary

This boundary applies before every browser action:

1. Run exactly:

   ```bash
   $HOME/.local/bin/cloakbrowser-cdp-health
   ```

   If the command is missing or exits nonzero, stop immediately and report `NOT_PROVEN`.
2. Browser execution is permitted only through:
   - the exact `$HOME/.local/bin/playwright-cli` executable; `run-code` and `--filename` are forbidden;
   - the approved Chrome DevTools MCP transport, exactly `/bin/sh -c 'exec "$HOME/.local/bin/chrome-devtools-mcp" --headless --isolated --no-usage-statistics --no-performance-crux'`.
3. Never execute the Webwright Python runtime, stock/raw/in-app Browser, `browser_agent`, `node_repl`, computer-use, Playwright MCP, raw Playwright, `bunx`, `npx`, direct package invocations, alternate CDP endpoints, alternate browser executables, alternate browser configs, or any fallback. No fallback is allowed.

Use named sessions and keep temporary browser evidence under `browser/` when the managed CLI emits a selectable output location. Capture before/after or state-specific evidence and report `NOT_PROVEN` instead of inventing evidence.

Run the health command again before each line that performs a browser action:

```bash
$HOME/.local/bin/cloakbrowser-cdp-health
$HOME/.local/bin/playwright-cli -s="${RY_PROJECT_SLUG:-rldyour}" open "$URL"
$HOME/.local/bin/cloakbrowser-cdp-health
$HOME/.local/bin/playwright-cli -s="${RY_PROJECT_SLUG:-rldyour}" snapshot
$HOME/.local/bin/cloakbrowser-cdp-health
$HOME/.local/bin/playwright-cli -s="${RY_PROJECT_SLUG:-rldyour}" screenshot
$HOME/.local/bin/cloakbrowser-cdp-health
$HOME/.local/bin/playwright-cli -s="${RY_PROJECT_SLUG:-rldyour}" tracing-start
```
