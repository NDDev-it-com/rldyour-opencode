# Design Validation

## Purpose

Prove that design work is visually accurate, functionally correct, responsive, accessible enough for the scope, and aligned with business behavior.

This skill depends on browser skills, especially `browser-validation`.

## When To Use

Use this skill without waiting for explicit invocation when the task has changed or created:

- Frontend UI, layout, styling, responsive behavior, visual states, animations, or interactions.
- Figma-to-code implementation, shadcn/ui components, ReactBits components, or design-system tokens.
- User-visible page, widget, feature, form, modal, menu, navigation, or stateful component behavior.

If browser tools cannot run, state the blocker and perform the strongest available static checks instead. Do not mark meaningful design work as complete without either browser evidence or an explicit validation blocker.

## Required Checks

For every meaningful design implementation, validate:

- Figma match: visual comparison against the inspected frame or supplied reference.
- Pixel-perfect details: spacing, typography, colors, radii, shadows, layout, assets, states.
- Design-system consistency: tokens, shared primitives, shadcn variants, no duplicate raw values.
- Functionality: interactions, form flows, navigation, modals, menus, state transitions.
- Business logic: required fields, permissions, calculations, data visibility, edge cases.
- Responsiveness: desktop plus mobile by default, and every provided Figma frame size.
- Runtime health: console errors, failed network requests, hydration/runtime issues when relevant.
- Accessibility basics: semantic controls, labels, keyboard reachability, focus visibility.
- Motion: purposeful, performant, reduced-motion friendly when ReactBits or custom animation is used.

## Browser Evidence

Use `browser/` for all browser artifacts:

- `browser/<feature>-figma-reference.png` when a reference screenshot is created.
- `browser/<feature>-desktop.png`.
- `browser/<feature>-mobile.png`.
- `browser/<feature>-state-<name>.png`.
- `browser/<feature>-trace.zip` or similar only when useful.

Do not commit browser artifacts. Delete them after the task unless the user explicitly asks to keep them.

## Validation Workflow

1. Use Figma source inspection for frame, token, component, text, and constraint facts.
2. Use Playwright CLI for browser flow reproduction, screenshots, snapshots, viewport matrices, accessibility-relevant visual evidence, and visual diff evidence.
3. Use Chrome DevTools MCP for computed style, layout, console, network, runtime, performance, memory, or Lighthouse diagnosis when relevant.
4. Compare reference and actual screenshot evidence; use project-native screenshot comparison only when already adopted.
5. Fix mismatches and re-run checks.
6. Report remaining mismatches or blockers explicitly with reference, actual screenshot, diff/deviation, and evidence paths.

## Done Criteria

Design implementation is not done until:

- The main Figma frame or provided design reference is represented in the browser.
- Critical visual states and responsive frames are checked.
- Functional and business behavior affected by the design is checked.
- Runtime blockers are absent or documented.
- Screenshots/evidence are either cleaned or intentionally kept by user request.

## Output

Report in Russian:

- `Visual checks`: frames/viewports/states checked.
- `Screenshots`: artifact paths under `browser/` and cleanup status.
- `Functional checks`: flows and business rules verified.
- `Runtime checks`: console/network/performance status if checked.
- `Fixed mismatches`: visual or behavioral issues corrected.
- `Residual gaps`: exact missing Figma access, assets, credentials, states, or browser constraints.

## Anti-patterns

- Declaring done without visual evidence from browser.
- Testing only desktop when Figma has mobile frame.
- Pixel-perfect claim without cross-reference with Figma source.
- Ignoring console errors during visual validation.
- Committing screenshots into repo.
- Skipping accessibility and reduced-motion checks for interactive components.
